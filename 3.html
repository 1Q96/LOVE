Jungle was founded by Tom McFarland and Josh Lloyd-Watson.[1] The pair had been friends since they were nine years old, where they lived next door to each other in Shepherds Bush, London.[2] They both attended Latymer Upper School, and played together within a number of different groups, one of which, Born Blonde, saw some success.[3] They went on to form Jungle at the beginning of 2013, choosing to put an aesthetic emphasis on the music’s surrounding artwork and videos, and not on the pairs' own identity, (McFarland and Lloyd-Watson came to be known as J and T).[4] Throughout the following year Jungle developed its nature as a collective by working with different artists across diverse disciplines. To perform the music live, Jungle expanded to a seven-piece band, fronted by J and T. The pair wished to challenge themselves, resisting the temptation to simply re-produce their music from their laptops, and instead translated their songs into a full and organic live experience. J and T have explained that Jungle stemmed from a desire for ‘honesty… true connection and friendship. It’s about being in a collective and collective energy… [a] team spirit.’ [5]
