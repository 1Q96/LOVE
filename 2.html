    <p>Rhye is an R&B musical project of Canadian singer Mike Milosh.
    It originally consisted of him and Danish instrumentalist Robin Hannibal.
    They released the singles "Open" and "The Fall" online without much
    detail, which led to speculation about the band. Their debut album,
    Woman, was released on March 4, 2013. In June 2013, the album was
    longlisted for the 2013 Polaris Music Prize. In 2017, it was reported
    that Robin Hannibal was no longer a member of Rhye and that the project
    had evolved into a music collective led by Milosh and focused around
    the associated live band.[5] Their second album, Blood, was released
    on February 2, 2018, and was largely written, produced, and performed
    by Milosh.
